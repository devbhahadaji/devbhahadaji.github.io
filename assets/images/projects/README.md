# Project Images Placeholder

Since your projects directory is empty, I'll help you understand what's needed:

## Missing Project Images:

Your _config.yml references these project images that don't exist:
- `/assets/images/projects/ecommerce.jpg`
- `/assets/images/projects/taskmanager.jpg` 
- `/assets/images/projects/weather.jpg`
- `/assets/images/projects/analytics.jpg`
- `/assets/images/projects/portfolio.jpg`
- `/assets/images/projects/recipe.jpg`

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Add Real Project Screenshots
Add actual screenshots of your projects with these exact names.

### Option 2: Remove Image References (Temporary)
I can update your _config.yml to remove the image references so projects show with placeholders.

### Option 3: Use Generic Placeholder Images
I can create simple colored placeholder images for now.

## Recommended Action:
Let me update your _config.yml to remove the image references temporarily so your projects display with the built-in placeholder design.
