Tractor Service represents a modern approach to enterprise software, leveraging serverless architecture for optimal scalability and cost efficiency. The platform serves multiple organizations with isolated data and customizable workflows.

## Technical Architecture

The frontend is built with React and Redux for state management, consuming APIs deployed as AWS Lambda functions. S3 handles file storage with CloudFront distribution for fast content delivery.

## Performance Metrics

The serverless approach resulted in 40% cost reduction compared to traditional server hosting while improving response times through geographic distribution.
